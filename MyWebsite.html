	<h1>My name is Kassondra Jones...</h1>
	<h3>...but you can call me Kassie...</h3>

	<p>I was born in April of 1989 to my parents in Rochester Hills,
		Michigan. When I was 7 years old, we moved to the downriver area after
		my grandpa got sick. I spent the rest of my childhood and teen years
		in Woodhaven going to school, making friends, and getting my first few
		jobs. After graduation, I went to Wayne State University where I
		studied Political Science with the intention of eventually going to
		law school. In 2012 I married my wonderful husband, after only dating
		for a year and a half. While that may seem fast, we have known each
		other since middle school. When you know you've found the right
		person, you just know.</p>
	<p>In my last semester of undergrad, I got pregnant with my oldest
		daughter. While she is one of the best things to have happened to me,
		her birth changed everything for me. Instead of moving into a graduate
		program at the university, I took a position in Human Resources with
		the hope that it would provide a positive work-life balance.</p>
	<p>It did not.</p>
	<p>Shortly after, I had my second child. Another beautiful, sassy
		little girl. Now that our family was complete, it was time that I
		decided what to do with my career. I pursued the Grand Circus Java
		bootcamp because it appeared to be the most efficient avenue to
		transition into a new industry.</p>
	<p>From here, my plans are to do the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Continue to learn as many Java functions as possible</li>
		<li>Land a job with a mid-size company and continue to grow as a
			developer</li>
		<li>Move into a teaching and/or mentor role for new developers</li>
		<li>Learn at least one more back-end language</li>
		<li>Learn more advanced front-end skills to earn the full-stack
			classification</li>
		<li>Long term goal -- to, in some way, help influence more
			girls/women into STEM pathways</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Being a full-time mom, in addition to the bootcamp, leaves
		little time for hobbies and personal free time. That being said, I
		have always loved performance art. I love live music of all genres,
		theater, dance, and anything that can make an audience feel something
		powerful or special. Last year, a bucket-list experience was checked
		off when I attended a showing of Phantom of the Opera and sat on the
		main floor, directly beneath the falling chandelier. It's going to
		take a lot to top that moment, but I am always on the lookout for
		something that can or will!</p>
